# Residence-Occupancy Matrices for Hermosillo, Sonora, MÃ©xico
This repository features videos displaying images of occupancy rates in different regions (AGEBs) of Hermosillo during the COVID-19 pandemic. These visualizations are based on the residence-occupancy matrix (ROM) calculated from mobile phone sensing data. The data spans five distinct time periods between September and December 2020.

These visualizations are part of our research on urban mobility and occupancy rates, detailed in our article titled "_Use of mobile phone sensing data to estimate residence and mobility times in urban patches: Human mobility restrictions and COVID-19_", https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2219155/v1.

Each row of the ROM represents the proportion of time that residents of a specific AGEB (identified by the row number) spent in other AGEBs. Using these rows, we created heatmap-style visualizations to illustrate the occupancy rates of residents in various AGEBs. These visualizations have been compiled into videos to provide clear and concise insights into regional occupancy trends during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.
